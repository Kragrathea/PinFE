B2S.Server
----------
System files to run 'directB2S' backglasses.



Installation:
-------------
- First of all check the color depth of the backglass monitor. It has to be 32bit.

- The B2S backglass server requires .NET Framework 4 installed on your computer. If it is not installed, it can be downloaded from www.microsoft.com:
  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=0a391abd-25c1-4fc0-919f-b21f31ab88b7&displaylang=en

- Unzip all files into your VP tables folder and overwrite already existing files with this new ones.

- Rightclick the 'B2SBackglassServer.dll' and click on 'Properties'. Maybe you'll find the following text on the 'General' tab:
  "This file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer". Click on the "Unblock" button.
  Everyting is fine when you are not able to find this text.

- Start the 'B2SBackglassServerRegisterApp.exe' in the VP tables folder and the server dll should be registered.
  IMPORTANT: With Win7 start the exe as administrator.

- You're ready to download and play some 'directB2S' backglasses.



Backglass settings:
-------------------
You can set, tweak and save a lot settings for each backglass. To get into this settings screen, 
please click the backglass with the mouse and press 'S' on your keyboard. A dialog window opens.

In this settings dialog you're able to:
- hide or show the VPinMAME DMD, the B2S DMD and/or the grill
- do some performance tuning, especially with the 'Skip ... frames' settings
- do some LED settings
- setup the screenshot settings to create screenshots from the running backglasses with the 'Print' or 'Print screen' key
- Do some VPinMAME data logging



Pretty important when you're having some stutter:
-------------------------------------------------
- Check the color depth of the backglass monitor. It has to be 32bit.
- Check the 'Start the backglass in EXE mode' check button and restart the backglass
- Tweak with the "Skip ... frames". Maybe start with Lamps 2 or 3, Solenoids 10 and LED 2.
- Tweak with the LED type. Try to use the "Simple LEDs".
- Don't forget to save your settings.
